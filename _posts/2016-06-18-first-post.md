Hi! My name is Spencer (you can call me sapsley), and I like to build things.  Some of the things I like to build are:

* Lego spaceships
* Mobile apps
* Spotify playlists

I made this blog so I can share the things I've built and what I've learned from building them.  

You seem cool.  Let's build something together.
